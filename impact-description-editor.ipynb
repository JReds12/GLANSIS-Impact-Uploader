      "The prevalence of <em>Heterosporis sutherlandae</em> in Great Lakes yellow perch can range between 5% and 30%, with the majority of infections at 20%.\n",
      "Laboratory-based infections of <em>Heterosporis sp.</em> have been observed in Great Lakes native species, including channel catfish (<em>Ictalurus punctatus</em>), bluegill (<em>Lepomis macrochirus</em>), and white sucker (<em>Catostomus commersonii</em>). The latter two species are less susceptible and experience much less muscle damage than the catfish.\n",
      "Declines in the Great Lakes yellow perch stocks are believed to stress predator-prey relationships. There is no evidence to show <em>Heterosporis sutherlandae</em> causes fish mortality directly, but the destruction of muscle in infected fish increases susceptibility to predation.\n",
      "Lake Ontario commercial fisheries are concerned about the economic impacts of <em>Heterosporis sp.</em> as infected fish suffer a significant loss of muscle tissue and are not marketable (i.e., must be discarded).\n",
      "The presence of <em>Heterosporis sp.</em> in Lake Michigan may significantly impede the recovery of depressed yellow perch stocks, which have experienced population declines in Lake Michigan over the past decade. Economic impacts to the yellow perch fisheries could be realized if <em>Heterosporis sutherlandae</em> becomes established there.\n",
      "Laboratory-based infections of <em>Heterosporis sp.</em> have been observed in commercially valuable Great Lakes native species including brook trout (<em>Salvelinus fontinalis</em>), lake trout (<em>S. namaycush</em>), fathead minnow (<em>Pimephales promelas</em>), and largemouth bass (<em>Micropterus salmoides</em>), and valuable non-native species including Coho salmon (<em>Oncorhynchus kisutch</em>), rainbow trout (<em>Oncorhynchus mykiss</em>), and brown trout (<em>Salmo trutta</em>). The trout and minnow species are highly susceptible to infection, while the bass and salmon are marginally susceptible and experience much less muscle damage if infected at all. Economic impacts to wild and cultured populations could be realized if natural infections are observed.\n",
      "While there have been no field observations of biological control of nonnative species in the Great Lakes, common carp (<em>Cyprinus carpio</em>) and goldfish (<em>Carassius auratus</em>) appear to be highly susceptible to infection by <em>Heterosporis sp.</em> based on laboratory experiments.\n",
      "In the Great Lakes, larval or immature <em>Ichthyocotylurus pileatus</em> have been detected in yellow perch (<em>Perca flavescens</em>) at a prevalence of 37.7% (582 fish examined), with light (1-9 parasites/host) to moderate (10-49 parasites/host) infections.\n",
      "The larval form of <em>Ichthyocotylurus pileatus</em> is also found in piscivorous birds of Lake Superior and the Lake St. Clair System.\n",
      "<Ichthyocotylurus pileatus> has the potential to be pathogenic to fish, particularly young individuals, when intensities of larvae/immature parasites are high.\n",
      "Fish parasites can cause pathological effects and mortality. Because of this, infected fish are more susceptible to predation.\n",

      "It is possible that the presence of <em>Ichthyocotylurus pileatus</em> in combination with that of other more prevalent parasites in Eurasian ruffe increases this species' susceptibility to the negative effects of anoxia.\n",
      "Multiple salmonids are susceptible to infection by <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em>, but the degree of susceptibility as well as symptom expression varies among species. Great Lakes native salmonid species susceptible to the pathogen include Atlantic salmon (<em>Salmo salar</em>), brook trout (<em>S. fontinalis</em>), cutthroat trout (<em>Oncorhynchus clarki</em>), and bull trout (<em>Salvelinus confluentus</em>). In contrast, lake trout (<em>S. namaycush</em>) is not susceptible to infection.\n",
      "Historically, the realized environmental impacts of whirling disease from <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em> on native Great Lakes aquacultured and wild species have been low.\n",
      "Whirling disease from <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em> can result in whirling behavior or tail-chasing, damage to the central nervous system and organs of equilibrium, lesions in the skull, gills, and vertebrae, and sometimes mortality.\n",
      "Stress from <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em> leads to a reduction in fish populations by making it difficult for individuals to effectively escape predators or feed. However, cascading food web effects as a result of <em>M. cerebralis</em> infection have not been reported in the Great Lakes.\n",
      "Whirling disease from <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em> has no known human health effects.\n",
      "In 2006, low-level infections of <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em> spores were detected in rainbow trout reared in a Pennsylvania state hatchery. <em>Whirling disease</em> spores were also isolated from Pennsylvania's Lake Erie steelhead in 1989, 1991, and 1997.\n",
      "However, wild trout populations of the mid-Atlantic region have not experienced observable declines, despite the presence of <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em> and susceptible species.\n",
      "In spring 2011, Michigan authorities conducted pre-stocking testing for <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em> on nine representative lots of hatchery fish (60 fish per lot, including brown trout, rainbow trout, chinook salmon, Atlantic salmon, coho salmon, lake trout, brook trout, splake, and lake herring), and all were found negative for the parasite.\n",
      "Molecular evidence of <em>Myxobolus cerebralis</em> was detected in one sample, which contained pooled tissue from a total of 60 brown and rainbow trout. The trout were collected from three different sources: Slagle Creek, Harrietta Effluent Pond, and Brundage Spring Pond.\n",
      "The only occurrence of <em>Neascus brevicaudatus</em> in the Great Lakes has been from the introduced Eurasian ruffe (<em>G. cernua</em>) at 5% prevalence with very light (<1 parasite/host) infections. Due to the slow rate of population growth and expansion of <em>N. brevicaudatus</em>, its impacts in the Great Lakes are believed to be negligible.\n",
